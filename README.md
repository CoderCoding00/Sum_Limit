# Sum Limit Instructions  
```md 
Given 2 non-negative ints, a and b, print their sum,
so long as the sum has the same number of digits as a.
If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b.

Provided 2 solutions and used Solution 1 becasue it is more efficient. Tested both solutions and they work. 

Example Test Out Put
• inputof(2,3) -> 5
• inputof(8,3) -> 8
• inputof(8,1) -> 9
```
